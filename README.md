Q&A:
What does this do? How does it work?
If you have a website your making and you don’t want your directories to get cracked without having to copy and paste indexes under all folders (extremely annoying for dependency projects) you can just drag and drop the parent folder of the project and the program will find vulnerable directories and create a proxy inside index.pho to log their ip and the time and then redirect them to the host.
