Q&A:
What does this do? How does it work?
If you have a website your making and you don’t want your directories to get cracked without having to copy and paste indexes under all folders (extremely annoying for dependency projects) you can just drag and drop the parent folder for your project to "blindHTML.exe" and the program will find vulnerable directories and create an index.php file inside the vulnerable directory and then it'll log the client'a ip and then redirect them to the main domain directory.
